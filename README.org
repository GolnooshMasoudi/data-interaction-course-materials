This course aims to give you an understanding of back-end development and in it you will learn how to build an HTTP server in node.js and integrating it with a MongoDB database. The course will focus a lot on JavaScript and give you an understanding for how the language works so you will be able to solve issues in your code more readily.

You can find working code samples for each chapter along with some exercises in [[https://github.com/iensu/data-interaction-course-materials][the course Github repository]].

* Setting up your Environment
In order to follow along with this course you will want to have the following installed:

- [[https://nodejs.org/en/][node.js]] v16 or higher
- ~npm~
- An editor with proper JavaScript support (VSCode, Sublime, Vim, Emacs, ...)
- [[https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git][Git]]

You can check that you have all necessary command line tools by running the following commands in your terminal:

#+begin_src shell
  node --version
  npm --version
  git --version
#+end_src

** MongoDB
Finally you will need to have access to [[https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/][MongoDB]]. The company MongoDB is pushing really hard for you to use the free-tier of their cloud service Atlas. Unfortunately it requires you to create an account and forces you to go through a lot of settings and options. It's important that you choose the free tier, otherwise you can just use the defaults. They will also apparently bombard you with marketing emails, so if you decide to create an account I recommend you use a throwaway email account.

If you don't like to go through the hassle of setting up an account you can either 1) install MongoDB locally following the instructions in link above or 2) use [[https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo/][the Docker image]] if you are comfortable with Docker. Personally I installed it locally.

MongoDB Compass offers a graphical interface to your database and often comes bundled when installing it locally. If you don't have it installed you can follow [[https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass][these instructions]].

*** Installing and running MongoDB on MacOS
As long as you have [[https://brew.sh/][Homebrew]] installed it's very easy to install both MongoDB and MongoDB Compass on your computer:

#+begin_src shell
  brew install mongodb
  brew install mongodb-compass
#+end_src

Installing the =mongodb= package should give you two commands:
- =mongo= for interacting with a MongoDB database.
- =mongod= for starting a MongoDB database process (the final /d/ stands for /daemon/ and means a long-running process).

You can start the database by simply running ~mongod~ in a terminal. You can shut it down by either closing the terminal window or by interrupting the process (hitting Ctrl-c).

*** Installing and running MongoDB on Windows
As long as you have Windows 10 (October 2018 update) or newer it's very easy to install both MongoDB and MongoDB Compass on your computer using =winget=:

#+begin_src shell
  winget install mongodb.server
  winget install mongodb.compass.full
#+end_src

Installing =mongodb.server= installs mongodb as a service that automatically starts when you start your computer. 
You can change it with the =services= application (or =sc= if you rather like using a terminal).

The MongoDB Compass application is easily launched by pressing Start and typing =mongodb=.

* Introduction to node.js
In short, node.js is JavaScript for servers and is now one of the most prevalent programming languages in the world. How come it quickly got so popular?

- The same language across the stack (front-end and back-end)
- Simplify the transition to full-stack for front-end developers
- The asynchronous nature of JavaScript makes it great for easily building high performance HTTP servers

In summary: familiarity and performance

Node.JS was created 12 years ago by creating a system interface to Chrome’s [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V8_(JavaScript_engine)][V8 JavaScript engine]]. That means that Node.JS is running the same version of JavaScript as Chrome and other [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium_(web_browser)][Chromium]]-based browsers such as Microsoft Edge, Brave etc. Which V8 version Node uses dictates what JavaScript features it supports. If you are curious you can check which exact version of V8 your node.js installation is using by running the following command in a terminal:

#+begin_src shell
  node -p process.versions.v8
#+end_src

** node.js vs the Browser
Moving JavaScript out of the browser and onto the server results in a few important differences:

- There's no browser environment, that is you do not have access to the global ~window~ and ~document~ objects.
- You instead have the global variable ~global~ to refer to the global scope.
- You have the global variable ~process~ for reading environment variables etc.
- You have access to built-in modules for doing things like reading and writing files and networking etc.

** Hello Node
We are going to play around with node.js a bit. First create a new directory called ~hello-node~ and move into it. Now create a file called =index.js= and write the following piece of code:

#+caption: Writing to the terminal
#+begin_src js -n
  console.log("Hello node! \(>0<)/")
#+end_src

Now you can run your program with the command ~node index.js~ and you should see =Hello node! \(>0<)/= printed to your terminal. We have run JavaScript outside of the browser and successfully printed text, hooray!

#+begin_aside
*Why index.js?*

Naming the main file JavaScript file =index.js= is a convention and has no special meaning to node.js itself apart from it being loaded by default when importing a directory. You can think of it as being analogous to =index.html= on a website.
#+end_aside

*** Using built-in modules
Let's use the built-in file system module ~fs~ to play around with files.

#+caption: Writing to files
#+begin_src js -n
  import fs from "fs";

  const databases = [
    { name: 'MongoDB', type: 'document' },
    { name: 'PostgreSQL', type: 'relational' },
    { name: 'Neo4j', type: 'graph' },
    { name: 'Redis', type: 'in-memory' },
  ];

  fs.writeFileSync("test.txt", JSON.stringify(databases, null, 2));

  const contents = fs.readFileSync("test.txt").toString();

  console.log(`File contents: ${contents}`);
#+end_src

#+begin_aside
*ES6 modules vs. CommonJS modules*

The node.js ecosystem is in a state of transitioning towards ES6 modules from the default CommonJS style modules. ES6 modules are sometimes referred to as JavaScript modules or EcmaScript modules.

#+caption: Syntax comparison between ES6 and CommonJS modules
|                 | ES6               | CommonJS                 |
|-----------------+-------------------+--------------------------|
| Imports         | =import x from 'x'= | =const x = require('x')=   |
| Named exports   | =export x=          | =module.exports.x = { x }= |
| Default exports | =export default x=  | =module.exports = x=       |

In the examples in this course we are going to use ES6 modules because that syntax is commonly used on the front-end. In order to use ES6 modules in node.js code you need to set the ~type~ property to ~module~ in =package.json=. You can quickly generate a =package.json= file by running ~npm init --yes~ in the terminal.

#+caption: Add support for ES6 modules by editing package.json
#+begin_src json
  {
    "name": "hello-node",
    "type": "module",
    ...
  }
#+end_src

The difference between the module systems lies not only in cosmetics but also semantics, ES6 modules being a lot more restrictive in when and how you can import modules. Given the flexibility of CommonJS modules we might never see a full transition to ES6 modules.
#+end_aside

*** Writing our own module
Let's create new module with a function that randomly picks an element from a list. And let's call it from =index.js=.

#+caption: random-element.js
#+begin_src js -n
  export default function randomElement(xs) {
    const randomIndex = Math.floor((Math.random() * 10) % xs.length)

    return xs[index];
  }
#+end_src

#+caption: index.js
#+begin_src js
  import fs from "fs";
  import randomElement from './random-element.js';

  const databases = [
    { name: 'MongoDB', type: 'document' },
    { name: 'PostgreSQL', type: 'relational' },
    { name: 'Neo4j', type: 'graph' },
    { name: 'Redis', type: 'in-memory' },
  ];

  // ...

  const randomDatabase = randomElement(databases);

  console.log(`Got database: ${randomDatabase}`);
#+end_src

*** Messing around with the global scope
Using modules is not the only way of sharing functionality, you can also manipulate the global scope by modifying the ~global~ variable.

#+caption: modifying-global-scope.js
#+begin_src js -n
  let count = 0;

  global.ourGlobalFunction = (source) => {
    count++;
    console.log(`Call count: ${count} (from ${source})`);
  };
#+end_src

#+caption: Importing the file updates the global scope (index.js)
#+begin_src js -n
  import fs from "fs";
  import randomElement from './random-element.js';
  import './modifying-global-scope.js';

  global.ourGlobalFunction(import.meta.url);

  // Since the scope is global we can even call it directly as well
  ourGlobalFunction(import.meta.url);

  // ...
#+end_src

*Exercise* Try calling ~ourGlobalFunction~ from =randomElement.js=. Try both within the function and outside. Is it working? If not, why not?

Finally, *please do not modify ~global~ in /real/ code*. it breaks encapsulation and makes it more difficult to understand what's going on.

*** Reading environment variables
Another thing we can do in node.js that we can't do in the browser is to get information about the current environment especially things like environment variables.

We can access environment variables via the ~process~ variable:

#+caption: Reading environment variables
#+begin_src js
  console.log('USER:', process.env.USER); // Prints your username
  console.log('MY_VARIABLE', process.env.MY_VARIABLE); // Prints undefined
#+end_src

#+begin_aside
*What are environment variables?*

Environment variables are string key-value pairs declared in the environment and are used extensively to configure applications and services. On Linux and MacOS you can list all environment variables in the terminal by running the ~env~ command, on Windows you run ~SET~. Some common environment variables are listed blow:

#+caption: Examples of predefined environment variables
| Variable | Functionality                                              | OS                 |
|----------+------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------|
| ~PATH~     | Specifies which directories have executable programs       | Linux, MacOS, Win  |
| ~EDITOR~   | Specifies what editor to open files with from the terminal | Linux, MacOS, Win? |
| ~USER~     | The currently logged in user                               | Linux, MacOS, Win? |

Environment variables can be created freely and this allows us to configure our application depending on the environment (production, test, local development) without having to do explicit checks in the code itself.

On MacOS and Linux you can set environment variables with the ~export~ command.

#+caption: Setting the environment variable ~MY_VARIABLE~ in the terminal
#+begin_src shell
  export MY_VARIABLE=foo
#+end_src
#+end_aside

* Our First API
** What is an Application Programming Interface?
- An API is a set of exposed methods for interacting with a program or package.
- When you write a JavaScript module and export functions to interact with it you are designing an API.
- When you are interacting with a third-party package, for example =express=, you are using its API.
- Designing an API allows you to create a layer of abstraction which hides implementation details and simplifies using your service or package.

Often when we say API we actually mean an HTTP API to be specific, that is an API which is used over the internet using HTTP.

** Creating our API
Express is by far the most popular NPM package for creating HTTP APIs in node.js and has been around almost as long as the language itself. Start by creating a new directory called =hello-express= and initialize it using ~npm init~ (also don't forget to update =package.json= if you want to use ES6 modules). Now let's install Express:

#+begin_src shell
  npm install express
#+end_src

Now let's create our first API by creating a new file called ~index.js~ in the project root directory and write the following code:

#+caption: Our first API
#+begin_src js
  import express from 'express';

  const app = express();

  app.get('/hello', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Hello there!').end();
  });

  const PORT = 8080;

  app.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${PORT}`)
  });
#+end_src

There is /a lot/ to unpack here...
- We begin by creating an instance of an Express app.
- Then we /register/ a handler on the =/hello= endpoint which will respond with /Hello there!/.
- Lastly we start a server listening on /port/ 8080.

** Starting our server
Run your program by executing ~node index.js~. The first thing you will notice is that your program never quits: you see the message =Server running at http://localhost:8080= but you don't get a new prompt. This is because your program is running a *server* which is meant to serve *responses* to *requests* from *clients* and your program needs to be kept alive and running to be able to do that.

A client is whatever uses, or /consumes/, the API served by your server and can be anything from a web browser, website, another server or a command-line tool etc. For now, let's use our browser as the client and access the URL printed out by the program: [[http://localhost:8080]]. You should see an error message saying something like =Cannot GET /=.

#+caption: Accessing an unregistered endpoint results in an error message
#+attr_org: :width 700px;
#+name: not-found
[[./assets/cannot-get-slash.png]]

This means that we tried to =GET= something at the endpoint =/=. We'll get more into what =GET= actually means later when we talk about HTTP, but for now let's try changing the endpoint and go to [[http://localhost:8080/hello]] instead. Now you should instead see the expected message =Hello there!=.

#+caption: Successful call to our /hello endpoint
#+attr_org: :width 700px;
#+name: hello-there
[[./assets/hello-express-endpoint.png]]

So what went wrong the first time? There are four pieces of information needed to interact with a server:

- The *protocol* the server expects (=http=)
- The *machine* the server is running on (our machine =localhost= or =127.0.0.1= if we use its IP address). This is also called the *host*.
- The *port* the server is listening on (=8080=)
- The *endpoint* we want to consume (=/hello=)

A server only responds on the port it is listening on and only handles requests on endpoints which have been registered on it. When not specifying an endpoint, the browser will pick the default one which is =/= and since we never registered a handler for that endpoint the request failed. You can think of endpoints as file paths on your own computer.

#+begin_aside
*Ports*

You can choose any port number for your service between 1025 to 65535 as long as some other currently running service (program) isn't already listening on it. It is very common to see people assign 8080 and I think this comes from repeating 80 which is the default port for the HTTP protocol. When you specify =http://= in the URL =:80= is implicitly appended to the host. In other words, a port is always used even if it is not explicit in the URL. Below is a table of some reserved ports:

|  Port | Protocol |
|-------+----------|
|    80 | =http://=  |
|   443 | =https://= |
|    22 | =ssh://=   |
| 20,21 | =ftp://=   |
#+end_aside

** Adding another endpoint

#+caption: Our next endpoint
#+begin_src js
  // ...

  app.get('/another-page', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Another page!').end();
  });

  // ...
#+end_src

If we add another endpoint and try to access it in the browser: [[http://localhost:8080/another-page]] we get the same error message as we did before.

The reason is that the server process is already running and changes made to the code will not be reflected until it is restarted. You can stop the server by selecting the terminal where it is running and press Ctrl-c (that means pressing the Ctrl button and the =c= key at the same time). This will terminate your server and get you back to the terminal prompt.

If you now run ~node index.js~ again you will be able to access [[http://localhost:8080/another-page]].

*** Live-reload and other tooling
A workflow like the above is not only annoying but it can also lead to long troubleshooting sessions trying to figure out why something isn't working, when in the end you just had to restart the server. Thankfully there is an NPM package which helps us automate this workflow: [[https://nodemon.io/][nodemon]]. Since we only need it for development we install it as a development dependency:

#+begin_src shell
  npm install --save-dev nodemon
#+end_src

Now we add a convenience script called ~dev~ in =package.json= to make it easy to use it:

#+begin_src json
  {
    // ...
    "scripts": {
      "dev": "nodemon index.js",
      "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
    }
    // ...
  }
#+end_src

By running ~npm run dev~ your server will be started up and =nodemon= will watch your files for changes and restart the server when necessary.

There is another tool I highly recommend you install and that is [[https://prettier.io/][prettier]]. This tool formats your code automatically and you should be able to make your editor run it every time you save. Here is a [[https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode][VSCode plugin]] and here is one for [[https://github.com/prettier/prettier-emacs][Emacs]].

** Back to our endpoint
Let's make our new endpoint do something more interesting: let's see what happens if we serve a string which looks like HTML.

#+caption: Serving an HTML string
#+begin_src js
  // ...

  app.get("/another-page", (req, res) => {
    res
      .send(
        `
  <html>
  <head>
    <style>
    body {
      margin: 32px;
      background: hotpink;
      color: darkgreen;
      font-family: arial;
    }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Our beautiful page</h1>
    <marquee>We're serving a string which is rendered as a web page!</marquee>
  </body>
  </html>
  `
      )
      .end();
  });

  // ...
#+end_src

And we can see that our browser interprets it as HTML! The secret is that the browser interprets EVERYTHING as HTML, so we shouldn't be surprised.

While it's pretty cool that we can serve web pages as plain strings, what you usually want to do is to serve HTML files instead. We move our HTML to a file which we can call =beautiful-page.html=.

#+caption: Our beautiful HTML markup in a file of its own
#+begin_src html
  <html>
  <head>
    <style>
    body {
      margin: 32px;
      background: hotpink;
      color: darkgreen;
      font-family: arial;
    }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Our beautiful page</h1>
    <marquee>We're serving a string which is rendered as a web page!</marquee>
  </body>
  </html>
#+end_src

And we change our handler to read that file and serve its contents.

#+caption: Serving HTML from a file
#+begin_src js
  import express from "express";
  import fs from "fs";

  // ...

  app.get("/another-page", (req, res) => {
    const contents = fs.readFileSync("beautiful-page.html").toString();

    res.send(contents).end();
  });

  // ...
#+end_src

The page should load like before but the code looks a lot nicer without the inline HTML.

A website made up from files like this is called a *static website*. This is how the whole web worked through-out the 90s and the beginning of the 00s until *Single Page Applications* (SPAs) became a thing. In this course we will assume you will write your website as a SPA (in React), so we won't be serving static pages. In addition, the above code is highly inefficient and is just for illustrative purposes. First we are reading the HTML file for every request even though the contents doesn't change, this will lead to a lot of file system access which impacts performance. Second, we send the page a single string all at once which also impacts performance. If you are interested in how to serve static web pages using Express you can have a look [[https://expressjs.com/en/starter/static-files.html][at this documentation]].

* HTTP + API Deep-dive
* Intro to MongoDB
MongoDB is a [[https://www.mongodb.com/document-databases][document (NoSQL) database]] and has a few important characteristics which makes it a suitable as a first database:

- Flexible data schemas.
- Intuitive data models (basically looks like JSON).
- Simple yet powerful query language.

MongoDB, and document databases in general, are often used in MVPs and prototypes when you are still exploring and have yet to decide on the data models to use. This does not mean however that they are not production-ready: document databases are among the most scalable databases out there and allow for efficient horizontal scaling (this means running multiple connected instances in a database cluster).

While we discuss MongoDB specifically in this section many of the concepts are applicable to other document databases as well such as CouchDB and elasticsearch, though the terminology might be a bit different.

A MongoDB system consists of one or several *databases*, which each can have one or multiple *collections* and each collection contains *documents*. Documents are the central concept of a document database, naturally.

** Schemas
The main selling point of MongoDB compared to relational (SQL) databases (MySQL, Postgres, ...) is the flexibility. In relational databases you have to define how your data is structured and the relationship between different kinds of data models. The structure of your data is called its schema or sometimes its data model and defines the properties it has and what data types these properties have. Here's a made-up example of how a schema might look like:

#+description: Pseudo-code for a schema definition
#+begin_src js
  PersonSchema = {
    "id": "string",
    "name": "string",
    "age": "integer",
    "weight": "float",
  }
#+end_src

In a *relational database* a schema like the above ensures for instance that a ~Person~'s name is a ~string~ and that its weight is a ~float~. If you would try to store a ~Person~ with a ~string~ weight the operation would fail. This makes it difficult for bad and ill-structured data to enter the database.

In a *document database* schemas still exist, but they are just suggestions and are meant to improve performance when querying the data. As you most likely will see when you start to work with MongoDB yourself is that it will happily accept a ~float~ as the ~name~, or even allow you to insert documents with a completely different set of properties in the same collection.

#+caption: Table data view in MongoDB Compass showing the inferred types for each column
#+attr_org: :width 700px
#+name: schema-example
[[./assets/mongodb-compass-table-example.png]]


This flexibility is something to be mindful of and I recommend using MongoDB Compass to explore your data set from time to time to ensure that it looks like you expect it to.

** Operations
Operations are ways of interacting with your database in the terms of data, the most general operations being:

- *Create* data
- *Read* data
- *Update* data
- *Delete* data

These are often called CRUD operations for short.

The following sections describes what the common CRUD operations are in MongoDB and examples assume that you have a connected ~db~ database instance available:

#+caption: Prelude to the examples below
#+begin_src js
  const client = mongodb.MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017');
  await client.connect();

  const db = client.db('mongodb-intro');
#+end_src

The code assumes that you have the ~mongodb~ package in scope and you are in an ~async~ context where you can use ~async~.

*** Inserting
In MongoDB the act of creating data in a collection is called *inserting*.

#+caption: Inserting one document
#+begin_src js :session mongodb
  await db.collection('languages').insertOne({
    name: 'JavaScript',
    family: 'C',
    year: 1995
  });
#+end_src

#+caption: Inserting multiple documents
#+begin_src js :session mongodb
  const languages = [{
      name: 'Haskell',
      family: 'ML',
      year: 1990
    }, {
      name: 'Rust',
      family: 'ML',
      year: 2010,
    }, {
      name: 'Java',
      family: 'C',
      year: 1995,
    }, {
      name: 'Common Lisp',
      family: 'Lisp',
      year: 1984,
    }];

  await db.collection('languages').insertMany(languages)
#+end_src

*** Finding (Filtering or Querying)
The operations for reading data are called *find* in the API but are often referred to as filtering or querying as well.

#+caption: Empty filter returns all documents
#+begin_src js
  const cursor = db.collection("languages").find({});
  const results = cursor.toArray();

  console.log(results);
#+end_src

The ~find~ operation can potentially return a huge amount of documents depending on the size of your data set so it does not return the results directly, but a *cursor* pointing to the results. This allows you to either do further processing or return a subset of the results. You can get all of the matching results by calling its ~toArray()~ method as in the example above.

The simplest filter apart from an empty one is to match on properties exactly. In this example we are picking out allow of the programming languages related to C in our data set.

#+caption: Filtering with a specific property value
#+begin_src js
  const filter = {
    family: 'C' // Matching property exactly
  }
  const results = await db.collection('languages').find(filter).toArray();

  console.log(results);
#+end_src

The ~findOne~ operation will return the first document it finds which matches the filter.

#+caption: Finding one document
#+begin_src js
  const filter = {
    type: 'ML'
  }

  const result = await db.collection('languages').findOne(filter);
#+end_src

For more advanced filtering we use [[https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/query/][query operators]], you can quickly identify them since they start with a ~$~. Some common ones are ~$gte~ (greater-than-or-equal), ~$lte~ (less-than-or-equal) and ~$regex~ for matching against a [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions][regular expression]].

#+caption: Finding all languages with Java in their name
#+begin_src js
  const filter = {
    name: { $regex: /Java/ }
  }
  const results = await db.collection('languages').find(filter).toArray();

  console.log(results);
#+end_src

#+begin_aside
*What are regular expressions?*

Regular expressions (aka /regex/ and /regexps/) are a way of creating text search patterns. In JavaScript you can create regular expressions in two ways: ~/pattern/~ or ~new RegExp("pattern").~ Regexes are an invaluable tool and used all over the place so I highly recommend spending some time getting to know the syntax:

- [[https://cheatography.com/davechild/cheat-sheets/regular-expressions/][Regular expression cheatsheet]]
- [[https://regex101.com/][Regular expression test page]]
#+end_aside

We can also combine multiple operators to express more complex queries; the next example finds all of the languages created in the 90s.

#+caption: Finding all languages from the 90s
#+begin_src js
  const filter = {
    year: {
      $gte: 1990,
      $lte: 1999
    }
  };
#+end_src

You can sort your results with the cursor's ~sort~ method by passing it an object containing the property you want to sort on and ~1~ for ascending results (low to high) or ~-1~ for ascending (high to low).

#+caption: All programming languages sorted by year
#+begin_src js
  const cursor = await db.collection('languages').find({});
  const results = cursor.sort({ year: 1 }).toArray();

  console.log(results);

*** Deleting
Deleting documents is very similar to finding documents just replace the ~find~ or ~findOne~ methods with ~deleteMany~ or ~deleteOne~, the methods use the same kind of filters.

#+caption: Delete Java
#+begin_src js
  await db.collection('languages').deleteOne({
    name: 'Java'
  });
#+end_src

*** Updating
Updating can be seen as a combination of a find operation and a write operation. As with the other operations you can either call ~updateOne~ or ~updateMany~ to update multiple documents at the same time and these methods take two arguments: a filter object to specify which documents will be affected, and an update object defining the modification.

#+caption: Bringing JavaScript to the 2000s
#+begin_src js
  const filter = { name: 'JavaScript'};
  const modification = { $set: { year: 2022 } };

  await db.collection('languages').updateOne(filter, modification)
#+end_src
