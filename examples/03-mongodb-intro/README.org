* MongoDB intro

This project aims to show some basic MongoDB operations. This example uses CommonJS style modules in order to make them usable in the Node.JS REPL.

REPL stands for Read-Eval-Print-Loop and basically means a prompt where you can execute code and see what it does. It's very useful when acquainting oneself with a new package or the programming language in general. You can enter the REPL by running ~node~ in the terminal:

#+begin_src shell
  > 1 + 1
  2
  > dbUrl = 'mongodb://localhost:27017'
  'mongodb://localhost:27017'
  > mongodb = require('mongodb')
  # ...
  > client = new mongodb.MongoClient(dbUrl)
  # ...
  > await client.connect()
  # ...
  > getConnectedMongoClient = require('01-connecting-to-mongodb.js')
  # ...
  > client = await getConnectedMongoClient(dbUrl)
  # ...
#+end_src

To exit the REPL hit Ctrl-d once, or Ctrl-c twice.
